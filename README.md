# **Introduction**
Introduce the purpose and features of your advanced security system. Highlight the integration of technologies like blockchain, AI, IoT, and mobile apps. Emphasize its scalability and versatility.

---

# **File List**
Provide a clear breakdown of the files included in the system:
- `database_setup.sql`: Contains the database schema.
- `blockchain_access_log.sol`: Blockchain smart contract for logging access.
- `ai_model.py`: Python script for training and predicting access decisions.
- `mobile_app/`: Directory with iOS and Android app code.
- `web_dashboard/`: Directory with Flask backend and React frontend files.

---

# **JSP Diagram**
Create a JSP (Jackson Structured Programming) diagram to map out the structure of your system:
1. User interacts with the mobile app or web dashboard.
2. Requests pass through the IoT controller (Raspberry Pi) or API.
3. Data is validated and logged in the database and blockchain.
4. AI analyzes data and makes access control decisions.
5. Feedback is sent back to the user interface.

You can illustrate this using any diagramming tool or just sketch it out and refine.

# **How-To Guide**

## **4.1 Setting Up the Database**
1. Install and configure MySQL on your server or use a cloud-based MySQL provider.
2. Use the provided `database_setup.sql` file to create necessary tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE faces (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       encoding LONGBLOB NOT NULL,
       access_start TIME,
       access_end TIME,
       rfid_code VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,
       nfc_tag VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL
   );
   ```
3. Verify the database is functioning and accessible.

## **4.2 Implementing Blockchain**
1. Deploy the smart contract using Solidity to a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum or a private blockchain network).
2. Compile and deploy the contract using tools like Remix or Truffle:
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   contract AccessLog {
       struct AccessEvent {
           uint256 timestamp;
           string user;
           bool granted;
       }
       AccessEvent[] public accessEvents;
       function logAccess(string memory user, bool granted) public {
           accessEvents.push(AccessEvent(block.timestamp, user, granted));
       }
   }
   ```
3. Connect your application to the blockchain using Web3 libraries.

## **4.3 AI Access Control**
1. Install Python and required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn
   ```
2. Train the AI model using historical access data:
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   import numpy as np
   data = np.array([
       [8, 1],  # Timestamp and prior access
       [12, 0]  # No prior access
   ])
   labels = np.array([1, 0])  # 1 = access granted, 0 = denied
   model = RandomForestClassifier()
   model.fit(data, labels)
   def predict_access(time, history):
       return model.predict([[time, history]])[0]
   ```
3. Integrate the AI model into your application.

## **4.4 Mobile App Integration**
1. Develop apps for iOS and Android.
2. For iOS, implement NFC using Swift:
   ```swift
   import CoreNFC
   func scanNFC() {
       let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: true)
       session.begin()
   }
   ```
3. Use Python and OpenCV for facial recognition on the mobile app.

## **4.5 Building the Web Dashboard**
1. Set up the Flask backend for API endpoints:
   ```python
   @app.route('/stats')
   def get_stats():
       cursor.execute("SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM access_log GROUP BY name")
       stats = cursor.fetchall()
       return jsonify(stats)
   ```
2. Use React for the frontend to visualize stats and control doors:
   ```jsx
   fetch("/stats").then(res => res.json()).then(data => setStats(data));
   ```

# **Source Code**
Include all source code files in an organized directory structure. Provide comments and documentation for clarity.

---

# **Conclusion and Future Improvements**
Wrap up by summarizing the system and suggesting potential enhancements, such as voice recognition or smart home integrations.
